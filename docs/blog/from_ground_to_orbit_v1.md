# From Ground to Orbit - V 1.0

This is a project where I am going to take a look at what a rocket launch in its
details looks like. The view is as simple as possible, but still meaningful. It
means analytical solutions and probably no numerical solutions. We are going to
progress the numerical solutions later versions of this project.

## Goal

Gaining insights the physics of ascend phase of a rocket. For example what
parameters the ascend phase calculation has? How does the ascend angle change
affects the rocket, the fuel consumption? How the forces affecting the rocket
changes during ascend phase? But, still in a simple way. Another goal is to
identify what analytical solutions we have to describe the ascend phase, and
where we can reach out more insights for numerical solutions.

## The case

- we need to put a 2 tonnes heavy object on a 150 km height orbit.
- we need to calculate fuel need
- how long the rocket flies?
- what g forces will affect the vehicle and the object?

## The model

### Rocket

- Falcon 9 like performance.
- Single stage rocket.
- Aerodynamic drag is known
- the rockets mechanical stability and the forces it can deal with are known

### Weather conditions

- at this point they are ideal and can be ignored

### Launch location

- Cape Canaveral
